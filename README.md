# Pyratch
Another frontend for Scratch.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Download Pyratch. You have 3 options.
   1. **Preferred**: Use the [Pyratch Installer](https://github.com/GenericProgrammer1234/PyratchInstaller), follow the README there.
   2.  Clone the repository using Git.
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/GenericProgrammer1234/Pyratch -b stable
      ```
   3. 1. [Download the .zip file with this link](https://github.com/EngineerRunner/Pyratch/archive/refs/heads/stable.zip)
      2. Extract the zip file.
3. Navigate to the folder.
4. Install the dependencies. <!-- Update this when a requirements.txt file gets added -->
   ```sh
   pip install flask scratchattach
   ```
5. Run Pyratch!
   ```sh
   python interface.py
   ```

### Updating

Git allows updating very easily. If you used the Pyratch Installer or `git clone` to install Pyratch, you can just go navigate to the directory Pyratch is stored in and run:

```sh
git pull
```

Otherwise, you'll have to redownload Pyratch.
